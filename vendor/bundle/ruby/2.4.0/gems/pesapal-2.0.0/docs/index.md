Synopsis
--------

Basically it's a gem that makes it easy to integrate your app with
[Pesapal's][24] payment gateway. It Handles all the [oAuth stuff][1] abstracting
any direct interaction with the API endpoints so that you can focus on what
matters. _Building awesome_.

All this with no 3rd party oAuth library dependencies, it handles all the oAuth
flows on its own so your app is one dependency less.

The gem should be [up on RubyGems.org][7], it's [accompanying API reference
here][13], the [CHANGELOG here][21] and [all the releases here][12].

Ps: This documentation is based off `v2.0.0`. For older versions, rely on the
version specific documentation. You can find the link on [RubyGems.org][7].

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pesapal'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pesapal

Usage
-----

### Initialization

Initialize Pesapal object and choose the environment, there are two environments;
`:development` and `:production`. They determine if the code will interact
with the testing or the live Pesapal API.

```ruby
# Sets environment to :development
pesapal = Pesapal::Merchant.new(:development)

# Sets environment to :production
pesapal = Pesapal::Merchant.new(:production)
```

### Configuration

Use a hash as shown below (please note that Pesapal provides different keys for
different environments, make sure you choose the right one).

```ruby
pesapal.config = {
  callback_url: 'http://0.0.0.0:3000/pesapal/callback',
  consumer_key: '<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY>',
  consumer_secret: '<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET>'
}
```

### Posting An Order

Once you've finalized the configuration, set up the order details in a hash as
shown in the example below ... all keys **MUST** be present. If there's one that
you wish to ignore just leave it with a blank string but make sure it's included
e.g. the phonenumber.

```ruby
pesapal.order_details = {
  amount: 1000,
  description: 'this is the transaction description',
  type: 'MERCHANT',
  reference: '808-707-606',
  first_name: 'Swaleh',
  last_name: 'Mdoe',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  phonenumber: '+254722222222',
  currency: 'KES'
}
```

Then generate the transaction url as below. In the example, the value is
assigned to the variable `order_url` which you can pass on to the templating
system of your choice to generate an iframe. Please note that this method
utilizes all that information set in the previous steps in generating the url so
it's important that it's the last step in the post order process.

```ruby
# generate transaction url
order_url = pesapal.generate_order_url

# order_url will a string with the url example;
# http://demo.pesapal.com/API/PostPesapalDirectOrderV4?oauth_callback=http%3A%2F%2F1.2.3.4%3A3000%2Fpesapal%2Fcallback&oauth_consumer_key=A9MXocJiHK1P4w0M%2F%2FYzxgIVMX557Jt4&oauth_nonce=13804335543pDXs4q3djsy&oauth_signature=BMmLR0AVInfoBI9D4C38YDA9eSM%3D&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&oauth_timestamp=1380433554&oauth_version=1.0&pesapal_request_data=%26lt%3B%3Fxml%20version%3D%26quot%3B1.0%26quot%3B%20encoding%3D%26quot%3Butf-8%26quot%3B%3F%26gt%3B%26lt%3BPesapalDirectOrderInfo%20xmlns%3Axsi%3D%26quot%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2001%2FXMLSchema-instance%26quot%3B%20xmlns%3Axsd%3D%26quot%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2001%2FXMLSchema%26quot%3B%20Amount%3D%26quot%3B1000%26quot%3B%20Description%3D%26quot%3Bthis%20is%20the%20transaction%20description%26quot%3B%20Type%3D%26quot%3BMERCHANT%26quot%3B%20Reference%3D%26quot%3B808%26quot%3B%20FirstName%3D%26quot%3BSwaleh%26quot%3B%20LastName%3D%26quot%3BMdoe%26quot%3B%20Email%3D%26quot%3Bj%40kingori.co%26quot%3B%20PhoneNumber%3D%26quot%3B%2B254722222222%26quot%3B%20xmlns%3D%26quot%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.pesapal.com%26quot%3B%20%2F%26gt%3B
```

_Ps: Please note the `:callback_url` value in the `pesapal.config` hash ...
after the user successfully posts the order, the response will be sent to this
url. Refer to [official Pesapal Step-By-Step integration guide][18] for more
details._

### Querying Payment Status

Use this to query the status of the transaction. When a transaction is posted to
Pesapal, it may be in a PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED or INVALID state. If the
transaction is PENDING, the payment may complete or fail at a later stage.

Both the unique merchant reference generated by your system (compulsory) and the
pesapal transaction tracking id (optional) are input parameters to this method
but if you don't ensure that the merchant reference is unique for each order on
your system, you may get INVALID as the response. Because of this, it is
recommended that you provide both the merchant reference and transaction
tracking id as parameters to guarantee uniqueness.

```ruby
# option 1: using merchant reference only
payment_status = pesapal.query_payment_status("<MERCHANT_REFERENCE>")

# option 2: using merchant reference and transaction id (recommended)
payment_status = pesapal.query_payment_status("<MERCHANT_REFERENCE>","<TRANSACTION_ID>")
```

### Querying Payment Details

Same as querying payment status above, but the return value contains more
information (and is a hash as opposed to a string).

```ruby
# pass in merchant reference and transaction id
payment_details = pesapal.query_payment_details("<MERCHANT_REFERENCE>","<TRANSACTION_ID>")
```

The result is a hash that looks something like this ...

```ruby
{
  method: "<PAYMENT_METHOD>",
  status: "<PAYMENT_STATUS>",
  merchant_reference: "<MERCHANT_REFERENCE>",
  transaction_tracking_id: "<TRANSACTION_ID>"
}
```

### IPN Listening

Use the `ipn_listener` method to listen to Pesapal IPN calls to easily create an
appropriate response, example below.

```ruby
# pass in the notification type, merchant reference and transaction id
response_to_ipn = pesapal.ipn_listener("<NOTIFICATION_TYPE>", "<MERCHANT_REFERENCE>","<TRANSACTION_ID>")
```

The variable, `response_to_ipn`, now holds a response as the one shown below.
Using the status you can customise any actions (e.g. database inserts and
updates) and finally, it's up to you to send the `:response` back to pesapal. The
hard part is done for you.

```ruby
{
  status: "<PAYMENT_STATUS>",
  response: "<IPN_RESPONSE>"
}
```

_Ps: Refer to Pesapal official documentation to make sure you understand what
data Pesapal sends to IPN and what result they expect back._


Support & Issues
----------------

### To gem's documentation

Gem documentation is of two types, feel free to contribute to any;

1. Gem home page at [itskingori.github.io/pesapal-gem][26] _(simple step-by-step)_
2. API documetation generated by [Yard][25] _(very comprehensive)_

Gem home page is built on [Jekyll][27], which is a fun and easy to use static
site generator and [hosted on GitHub Pages][30]. The code is in the `docs/`
folder if you want to have a peek.

Preview the gem API documentation locally by installing [Yard][25] (`gem install
yard`) and call `$ yard server` to set up a local documentation server usually
running on `http://0.0.0.0:8808`. The result should be similar to the API
documention up on [rubydoc.info/gems/pesapal][13].

_Ps: If you've written code and can't figure out why they aren't passing (or if
you've written your own tests ... just send a pull a request. We can then do a
[code review][32])_.


Testing
-------

Tests run [RSpec][31] which is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool. To run
tests, call;

```bash
$ bundle exec rspec spec
```
