# Quick Start for Local Testing with Sample Data

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby.git
cd sendgrid-ruby
bundle install
```

Run the Inbound Parse listener in your terminal:

```ruby
rackup
```

In another terminal, run the test data sender:

```bash
cd [path to sendgrid-ruby]
bundle install
ruby ./lib/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/send.rb ./lib/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/sample_data/default_data.txt
```

More sample data can be found [here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/sample_data).

View the results in the first terminal.

# Quick Start for Local Testing with Real Data

[Setup your MX records.](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/Inbound_Parse_Webhook/setting_up_the_inbound_parse_webhook.html#-Setup) Depending on your domain name host, you may need to wait up to 48 hours for the settings to propagate.

Run the Inbound Parse listener in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby.git
cd sendgrid-ruby
bundle install
rackup
```

In another terminal, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to allow external access to your machine:
```bash
ngrok http 9292
```

Update your SendGrid Incoming Parse settings: [Settings Page](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/parse) | [Docs](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/Inbound_Parse_Webhook/setting_up_the_inbound_parse_webhook.html#-Pointing-to-a-Hostname-and-URL)

- For the HOSTNAME field, use the domain that you changed the MX records (e.g. inbound.yourdomain.com)
- For the URL field, use the URL generated by ngrok + /inbound, e.g http://XXXXXXX.ngrok.io/inbound

Next, send an email to [anything]@inbound.yourdomain.com, then look at the terminal where you started the Inbound Parse listener.

# Code Walkthrough

## app.rb

This module runs a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) server, that by default (you can change those settings [here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/config.yml)), listens for POSTs on http://localhost:9292. When the server receives the POST, it parses and prints the key/value data.

## config.yml

This module loads application environment variables (located in [config.yml](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/config.yml)).

## send.rb & /sample_data

This module is used to send sample test data. It is useful for testing and development, particularly while you wait for your MX records to propagate.
