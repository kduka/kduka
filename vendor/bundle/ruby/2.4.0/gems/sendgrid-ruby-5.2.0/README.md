**NEW:** Subscribe to email [notifications](https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/ruby) for releases and breaking changes.

**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the SendGrid Web API v3 via Ruby.**

Version 3.X.X+ of this library provides full support for all SendGrid [Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html) endpoints, including the new [v3 /mail/send](https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint).

This library represents the beginning of a new path for SendGrid. We want this library to be community driven and SendGrid led. We need your help to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right things in the right order, we ask that you create [issues](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further detail.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Ruby version >= 2.2
- The SendGrid service, starting at the [free level](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-ruby)

## Setup Environment Variables

Update the development environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), for example:

```bash
echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'" > sendgrid.env
echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env
```
## Install Package

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'sendgrid-ruby'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Or install it yourself using:

```bash
gem install sendgrid-ruby
```

## Dependencies

- [Ruby-HTTP-Client](https://github.com/sendgrid/ruby-http-client)
- [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) - this is only needed if you plan to process [Inbound Email](#inbound).

<a name="quick-start"></a>
# Quick Start

## Hello Email

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email with the [/mail/send Helper](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/lib/sendgrid/helpers/mail) ([here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/examples/helpers/mail/example.rb#L21) is a full example):

### With Mail Helper Class

```ruby
require 'sendgrid-ruby'
include SendGrid

from = Email.new(email: 'test@example.com')
to = Email.new(email: 'test@example.com')
subject = 'Sending with SendGrid is Fun'
content = Content.new(type: 'text/plain', value: 'and easy to do anywhere, even with Ruby')
mail = Mail.new(from, subject, to, content)

sg = SendGrid::API.new(api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'])
response = sg.client.mail._('send').post(request_body: mail.to_json)
puts response.status_code
puts response.body
puts response.headers
```

For more complex scenarios, please do not use the above constructor and instead build your own personalization object as [demonstrated here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/examples/helpers/mail/example.rb#L21).

### Without Mail Helper Class

The following is the minimum needed code to send an email without the /mail/send Helper ([here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/examples/mail/mail.rb#L26) is a full example):

```ruby
require 'sendgrid-ruby'
include SendGrid

data = JSON.parse('{
  "personalizations": [
    {
      "to": [
        {
          "email": "test@example.com"
        }
      ],
      "subject": "Sending with SendGrid is Fun"
    }
  ],
  "from": {
    "email": "test@example.com"
  },
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text/plain",
      "value": "and easy to do anywhere, even with Ruby"
    }
  ]
}')
sg = SendGrid::API.new(api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'])
response = sg.client.mail._("send").post(request_body: data)
puts response.status_code
puts response.body
puts response.headers
```

## General v3 Web API Usage (With Fluent Interface)

```ruby
require 'sendgrid-ruby'
sg = SendGrid::API.new(api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'])
response = sg.client.suppression.bounces.get()
puts response.status_code
puts response.body
puts response.headers
```

## General v3 Web API Usage (Without Fluent Interface)

```ruby
require 'sendgrid-ruby'
sg = SendGrid::API.new(api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'])
response = sg.client._("suppression/bounces").get()
puts response.status_code
puts response.body
puts response.headers
```
