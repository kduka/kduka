KDuka

In the year 2017, with my partner [@jtowett89](https://github.com/jtowett89), we started building KDuka, an eCommerce website generator that could get you an online shop within 5 minutes

With more premium features like custom domain names and special themes, you could customize pretty much every template to your liking + fully functional eCommerce features with dashboard and analytics.

We stopped working on this project in 2019. I learnt how to code with Ruby on Rails for this project. I then spent two years of my life writing this code because it was all the hope I had at that time.

I have a lot to say about how this was built from where I stand, but that is not important, All I see is the work that my young self put together.

I just want it to be out there, whether judged or appreciated. This was KDuka, the wild dream we spent our youth chasing.

PS:
1. Most of this stuff is deprecated, Ruby moves quick
2. I would really love to see a version of this thing running again, Unfortunately, I don't have the time to do that but If for any purpose you're willing to try to update this thing and get it running again. That would be awesome. I would totally jump on that train.
3. Feel free to use this code however you want :)
4. Zero test coverage. Welcome to bootstrapping for a start up with 2 coders
